# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-19)

**Core value:** One Docker command opens a Bloomberg-style terminal where prices stream live, trades execute instantly, and an AI copilot can analyze the portfolio and execute trades on the user's behalf.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — App Shell & Config

## Current Position

Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Adopt `planning/PLAN.md` wholesale as v1 scope — all 40 Active requirements mapped to 10 phases.
- Market-data subsystem (MARKET-01..06) treated as Validated and inherited — not planned.
- Granularity is "fine" (10 phases; 3–6 requirements each); workflow flags enabled: research, plan_check, verifier, nyquist_validation, ui_phase, ai_integration_phase.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

From codebase analysis (`.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md`) — carry into Phase 1 planning:
- `PriceCache` uses `threading.Lock` because `MassiveDataSource` writes via `asyncio.to_thread`. Must not be "simplified" to `asyncio.Lock` in the app-shell wiring.
- SSE generator polls at 500 ms and emits only on cache version change — no heartbeat. Watch for proxy-idle timeouts during demo.
- Daily-change baseline is session-relative; `session_start_price` must not be persisted to SQLite.
- Default seed tickers are duplicated across `seed_prices.py` and `market_data_demo.py`; Phase 2 DB seed must pick a single source of truth.
